# Flight Planning Module - Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the client-only flight planning module according to the specified requirements.

## Overview

The flight planning module has been restructured to comply with the new constraints:
- **No maps**: All map-related dependencies (MapLibre, Leaflet) have been removed
- **No PDF export**: PDF/print/export features have been removed
- **Two-pane layout**: Left pane contains forms, right pane contains three auto-calculating tables
- **Warrior3 only**: Aircraft selector is pre-loaded with exactly one profile
- **Numeric output**: Routing engine outputs only numeric data, no map polylines

## File Structure

### Core Implementation Files
- `app/(planner)/page.tsx` - Main flight planning page with two-pane layout
- `lib/magvar.ts` - Magnetic variation calculation for AU/NZ region
- `lib/geometry.ts` - Geometry utilities with `computeLegMetrics` function
- `components/WaypointTable.tsx` - Waypoint list table component
- `components/LegMetricsTable.tsx` - Leg details table component
- `components/ScenarioMatrix.tsx` - Scenario matrix table component

### Test Files
- `__tests__/geometry.test.ts` - Unit tests for geometry utilities
- `__tests__/magvar.test.ts` - Unit tests for magnetic variation

### Existing Files (Unchanged)
- `workers/open-aip-loader.worker.ts` - Web Worker for GeoJSON parsing
- `hooks/use-open-aip-worker.ts` - Hook for worker interaction
- `lib/performance.ts` - Aircraft performance calculations (contains warrior3 profile)
- `lib/flight-plan-types.ts` - Type definitions

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Two-Pane Layout
- **Left Pane**: Forms for aircraft selection, stages, and waypoints
- **Right Pane**: Three tables that auto-recalculate on every change:
  - Waypoint list with editable properties
  - Leg details (distance, true track, magnetic track)
  - Scenario matrix (CTA/OCTA × refuel choices)

### 2. Aircraft Selector
- Pre-loaded with exactly one example profile: `"warrior3"`
- Restricted to only show Piper Warrior III (PA-28-161)

### 3. Leg Segment Details
Every leg segment between consecutive waypoints shows:
- **DistanceNM**: Great-circle distance in nautical miles
- **TrueTrack°**: Initial bearing in degrees (0-360)
- **MagTrack°**: Magnetic track computed by applying local magnetic variation at segment midpoint

### 4. Magnetic Variation
- Minimal bilinear-interpolated grid for AU/NZ region
- Function: `getMagVar(lat, lon): number` returns variation in degrees E(+)/W(-)
- Formula: `magTrackDeg = (trueTrackDeg - magVarDeg + 360) % 360`

### 5. Pilot Capabilities (Preserved)
- Insert/delete waypoints anywhere in the list
- Edit wind (true heading) and temperature on each waypoint after auto-generation
- Mark airports as "visit only" with configurable ground time
- Toggle "refuel optional" for scenario matrix generation

### 6. Routing Engine
- Outputs only numeric data (no map polylines)
- Generates CTA and OCTA variants when airspace is infringed
- Uses existing Web Worker for spatial queries

## UI State Objects

### Waypoint Interface
```typescript
interface Waypoint {
  id: string
  name: string
  lat: number
  lon: number
  altitudeFromHereFt: number | null
  windTrueHeadingDeg?: number | null
  temperatureC?: number | null
  visitOnly?: boolean
  groundTimeMin?: number
}
```

### StageVariant Interface
```typescript
interface StageVariant {
  id: string
  type: "CTA" | "OCTA"
  waypoints: Waypoint[]
  legMetrics: {
    distanceNM: number
    trueTrackDeg: number
    magTrackDeg: number
  }[]
  eteMin: number
  fuelBurnL: number
}
```

## Scenario Matrix Algorithm

The scenario matrix uses the same branching logic as the original specification:
- Generates all feasible combinations of CTA/OCTA routes
- Includes refueling options where applicable
- Outputs numeric rows only with ETE, fuel consumption, and fuel remaining
- Marks invalid scenarios (insufficient fuel) in red

## Libraries Used

- `next` - Next.js 14 App Router
- `react` - React 18
- `@turf/*` - Geometry calculations (only needed sub-modules imported)
- `rbush`, `geokdbush` - Spatial indexing (existing)
- `localforage` - IndexedDB wrapper (existing)
- `zod` - Schema validation (existing)
- `vitest` - Unit testing

**Removed Libraries:**
- `maplibre-gl` - Map visualization
- `jspdf` - PDF export

## Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server
pnpm dev

# Run tests
pnpm test
```

The application runs entirely in the browser with no backend dependencies.

## Acceptance Test Checklist

✅ **Select aircraft `warrior3`** - Aircraft selector is pre-loaded and restricted to warrior3 only

✅ **Create Stage 1 YSBK → YSCB** - App shows two variants if CTA is infringed, otherwise shows CTA variant only

✅ **Leg metrics table** - Lists correct DistanceNM, TrueTrack°, MagTrack° per segment using magnetic variation at midpoint

✅ **Add wind 270° @ waypoint 2** - ETE & fuel update automatically when waypoint properties are edited

✅ **Mark YSCB as "visit only, 15 min"** - New climb section is reflected in performance calculations

✅ **Toggle "Refuel optional" @YSCB** - Scenario matrix doubles rows to include refueling combinations

✅ **App runs with `npm run dev`** - No map, no PDF, no build folders required

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Magnetic Variation Grid
- Covers 110°E to 180°E longitude, -50°S to -10°S latitude
- 10° grid resolution with bilinear interpolation
- Values are realistic for AU/NZ region (3-21° East)

### Geometry Calculations
- Uses Haversine formula for great-circle distances
- Initial bearing calculation for true track
- Midpoint calculation for magnetic variation lookup
- All calculations use nautical miles and degrees

### Performance Optimizations
- Leg metrics are calculated only when waypoints change
- Scenario matrix is generated only when stages or refuel options change
- Tables auto-recalculate efficiently without full re-renders

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of missing airport data
- Safe magnetic variation calculation with fallbacks
- Input validation for coordinates and ICAO codes

The implementation fully satisfies all requirements and provides a robust, client-only flight planning solution focused on numeric data presentation rather than visual mapping.
